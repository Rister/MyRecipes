\begin{recipe}{Butter Tart Squares}{}{}
  \newstep
  Line a 9\X 13 pan with parchment paper and spray with non stick spray.

  Preheat oven to 350\0 .

  \ingredient[2]{cups}{all purpose flour}
  \ingredient[4]{tbsp}{powdered icing sugar}
  In a large bowl, combine flour and powdered sugar.

  \ingredient[1]{cup}{unsalted butter (cold, cubed)}
  \ingredient[1--2]{tbsp}{cold water}
  Cut butter into icing sugar and flour with a pastry cutter or your
  hands until pea-sized lumps of butter remain.
  When you grab a handful and squeeze, you want it to hold together.
  If it doesn't hold together, add 1--2 tablespoons of water.

  \newstep
  Dump flour mixture into pan and press down evenly to form a crust.

  Bake for 10 minutes.

  \ingredient[\fr{1}{2}]{cup}{butter (unsalted)}
  Meanwhile, prepare your filling.

  In a medium bowl melt butter in the microwave.

  \ingredient[3]{cups}{brown sugar}
  Whisk in brown sugar until smooth.

  \ingredient[4]{}{large eggs}
  \ingredient[1--2]{tbsp}{white vinegar}
  \ingredient[1]{tbsp}{vanilla}
  \ingredient[\fr{1}{4}]{cup}{raisins (optional)}
  Whisk in eggs, one at a time, then add the vinegar and vanilla.

  \newstep
  Pour over crust and bake another 25-30 minutes until filling is set
  or almost set --- a slight jiggle is fine but you don't want a lot
  of movement.

  Cool to room temperature and refrigerate several hours before slicing.
