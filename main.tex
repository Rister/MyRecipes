\begin{recipe}{Butter Tart Squares}{}{}
    \newstep
    Line a 9\X 13 pan with parchment paper and spray with non stick spray.
    
    Preheat oven to 350\0 .

    \ingredient[2]{cups}{all purpose flour}
    \ingredient[4]{tbsp}{powdered icing sugar}
    In a large bowl, combine flour and powdered sugar.

    \ingredient[1]{cup}{unsalted butter (cold, cubed)}
    \ingredient[1--2]{tbsp}{cold water}
    Cut butter into icing sugar and flour with a pastry cutter or your hands until pea-sized lumps of butter remain.
    When you grab a handful and squeeze, you want it to hold together.
    If it doesn't hold together, add 1--2 tablespoons of water.

    \newstep
    Dump flour mixture into pan and press down evenly to form a crust.

    Bake for 10 minutes.

    \ingredient[\fr{1}{2}]{cup}{butter (unsalted)}
    Meanwhile, prepare your filling.

    In a medium bowl melt butter in the microwave.

    \ingredient[3]{cups}{brown sugar}
    Whisk in brown sugar until smooth.

    \ingredient[4]{}{large eggs}
    \ingredient[1--2]{tbsp}{white vinegar}
    \ingredient[1]{tbsp}{vanilla}
    \ingredient[\fr{1}{4}]{cup}{raisins (optional)}
    Whisk in eggs, one at a time, then add the vinegar and vanilla.

    \newstep
    Pour over crust and bake another 25-30 minutes until filling is set or almost set --- a slight jiggle is fine but you don't want a lot of movement.

    Cool to room temperature and refrigerate several hours before slicing.
